# sdhacks2019

Hi,
this is my team's submission to SD Hacks 2019!

We created a web application that immitates services such as personality quizzes on Buzzfeed.
In terms of technical skills, we mainly utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Version control also played a significant part in our collaboration together in working towards completing our goal.

Our team had a great time learning and challenging ourselves in this year's Hackathon! Spending hours on hours grinding code together was a blast. We're quite proud of the project we made this year, and we hope you enjoy it too!
